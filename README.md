### Map Layers
 - Streets view
 - Satellite view 
 - Dark view
 
### Earthquake Data Layers
 - All earthquake data with marker radius based on magnitude
 - Major earthquakes (magnitude greater than 4.5) with marker radius based on magnitude
 - Tectonic plates indicated via lines on the map
 
## Technology Used
The following technologies were used to create the map and layers. 
 - HTML
