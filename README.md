# Mapping Earthquakes Project Overview
Project completed as part of the Data Analytics Bootcamp Module 13 Challenge.

## Objective
The objective of the project was to layer earthquake data onto a map. The map consists of three map layers to provide multiple views. The map also includes three sets of earthquake data that can be applied. 
### Map Layers
 - Streets view
 - Satellite view 
 - Dark view
 
### Earthquake Data Layers
 - All earthquake data with marker radius based on magnitude
 - Major earthquakes (magnitude greater than 4.5) with marker radius based on magnitude
 - Tectonic plates indicated via lines on the map
 
## Technology Used
The following technologies were used to create the map and layers. 
 - HTML
 - JavaScript
 - CSS styling
 - GeoJSON
 - Visual Studio Code
 - MapBox

# Results
## Map Initial Load
Upon initial loading of the html page, the map will display with Streets view and all data layers applied (earthquakes, tectonic plates, major earthquakes).

## Customizing View
The user can use the layers option in the upper right-hand side of the screen to change the view from Streets to either Satellite or Dark. This will change the display of the background map.

The user can then select which data to view. Checking or unchecking the data options will display or hide, respectively, the data. 

A user can select to view all three data types.
